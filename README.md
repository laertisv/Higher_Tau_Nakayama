# Higher τ-tilting theory for linear Nakayama algebras

This project provides an interactive tool to visualize the higher τ-tilting theory of linear Nakayama algebras with homogeneous relations based on the results of the article [τ_d-tilting theory for linear Nakayama algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19505). 

## Features:
- Construction of τ_d-rigid pairs, with an easy way to check if they are summand maximal.
- Mutation of summand maximal τ_d-rigid pairs.
- Construction of d-torsion classes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laertisv/Higher_Tau_Nakayama.git
```

2. Open in Browser:
Navigate to the cloned directory and open index.html in your preferred web browser.
